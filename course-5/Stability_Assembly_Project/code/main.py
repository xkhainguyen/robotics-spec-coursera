    """
    Determines if an assembly of planar rigid bodies, in frictional contact 
    with each other, can remain standing in gravity (where gravity acts in 
    the - y direction), or if the assembly must collapse.
    Args:
      mass (list, (N, 3))       : static mass properties of N bodies, the (x,y)
                                location and total mass [kg]
      contacts (list, (n, 6))   : description of n contacts. Each contact 
                                consists of a list of the two bodies involved
                                in the contact (0 means stationary ground, 
                                1 means body 1, 2 means body 2, etc.); the (x,y) 
                                location of the contact; the contact normal 
                                direction into the first body involved in the 
                                contact; and the friction coefficient Î¼ at the 
                                contact. 
    Returns:
      (Boolean)                 : True if the assembly is stable;
