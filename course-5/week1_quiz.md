## Solution for Graded Quiz (Week 1 Course 5)
1. D (see 12.1.6 Planar Graphical Methods, take the intersection)
2. C (see 12.1.6 Planar Graphical Methods, take the intersection)
3. A, B, E, F, G (via each of these points, we can draw a contact normal that divides the space into (+) and (-), put the body in form closure after taking the intersection)
4. BB (from 4-7, see 12.1.6 Planar Graphical Methods)
5. BSr
6. SlB
7. BR
8. 2 (the sliding contact gives a 5-D of free twist space, it is then constrained by 3-D of rolling contact, so after all, we have 2-D free twist space)
9. SP (from 9-10, calculate wrenches F1 = [[p1]n1; n1], F2 = [[p2]n2; n2]; evaluate F*V)
10. BS
11. bbbb (see Fig. 12.10, there is four linear combination of three signs)
